# How Git Works

Within my 30 minutes of exploration of git, I found a few interesting things. I have been using git for only about 4 weeks totally, and I understand the basic concepts of a push and pull. My focus in this exploration was to explore how to properly merge and branch.

With being on a team of five while at NHTI, we managed to completely screw up our senior projectâ€™s repo because we were not taught source control at all. We, at the time, were using mercurial. Of which case was being hosted no where on the school campus. The thing that broke us, was the fact that none of us knew how to handle branches properly.

With my exploration in mind, I actually came across a problem at my internship. Some of the developers had been working on indirect files that were a part of the system that I was working on, so I needed to update my branch without pushing my stuff into the main branch. So, in the command console, I first had to stash whatever I was working on so that I could perform git commands. Next, while I was checkout on my branch, I performed a git merge and it worked flawlessly. After confirming I had what I needed, I pop the stash back to my working files.
