# How to setup for COMP 698

First what we need to do is blame whomever wanted us to document our own setup
because a workplace should be able to help it's employees to setup correctly. I
mean seriously, what workplace doesn't help their employees setup so that they
don't make a huge mistake.

The actual first thing we want to do is to write a list of all the technologies
that we are going to be working with. In this class we need:

 * Bash Shell
 * Git and Github account
 * Docker

# Setup Git and Github

You should be able to do this on your own. But in case, open a command terminal
and type in:

`sudo dnf install git`

When prompted, say yes to install. Be smart, think with common sense. Next is to
setup a github account. Google `github.com` and follow the steps to setup that.

# Docker

Docker, according from their own website:

>Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries â€“ anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.
